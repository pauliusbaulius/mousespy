# Privacy Policy

**Mouse Spy Browser Extension** takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains how the Mouse Spy browser extension collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Overview

Mouse Spy is a browser extension that collects mouse movement and interaction data from web pages you visit. This extension is designed to send this data only to user-configured API endpoints and does not share any data with the extension developer or third parties.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

The Mouse Spy extension collects the following types of data:

- **Mouse movements**: X and Y coordinates of mouse cursor movements
- **Mouse clicks**: Location and timing of mouse clicks
- **Scroll events**: Page scroll position and timing
- **Page information**: Domain name, viewport dimensions, and page visibility status
- **Timing data**: Timestamps for all events
- **User ID**: A randomly generated identifier stored locally in your browser

### What Is Not Collected

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browser history or bookmarks
- Passwords or login credentials
- Form data or text input
- Images or screenshots
- Audio or video content
- Any data from secure (HTTPS) pages beyond basic interaction events

## Data Storage and Transmission

### Local Storage
- All data is temporarily stored in your browser's local storage
- A unique user ID is generated and stored locally for data organization
- No data is stored on our servers

### Data Transmission
- Mouse interaction data is sent **only** to API endpoints that you configure
- Data is transmitted using standard HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- No data is sent to the extension developer or any third-party services
- **You have complete control over where your data is sent**

### Data Retention
- Data is processed in real-time and not stored permanently by the extension
- The extension does not maintain historical data beyond what's needed for current transmission
- Data retention is controlled by your configured API endpoint

## Data Usage

The collected data is used solely for:
- Sending mouse interaction data to your configured API endpoint
- Basic extension functionality (sampling, queuing, retry logic)

The extension developer does not:
- Access or view your collected data
- Use your data for any purpose
- Share your data with third parties
- Analyze or process your data beyond transmission

## Cookies and Tracking

This extension does not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms. All data processing occurs locally within your browser.

## Third-Party Services

- **No third-party services**: The extension does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services
- **User-configured endpoints**: Data is only sent to API endpoints that you explicitly configure
- **No external dependencies**: The extension operates independently without external service dependencies

## Security

### Data Protection
- All data processing occurs locally in your browser
- Data transmission uses standard HTTPS protocols when available
- No sensitive information is collected or transmitted

### Limitations
While we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. The security of your data ultimately depends on:
- Your configured API endpoint's security measures
- Your browser's security settings
- The security of your network connection

## Your Rights and Control

### Data Control
- **Complete control**: You decide where your data is sent by configuring the API endpoint
- **No data sharing**: The extension developer cannot access your data
- **Local processing**: All data processing occurs on your device
- **Opt-out capability**: You can disable the extension at any time

### Configuration
- You must explicitly configure an API endpoint for data transmission
- No data is transmitted without your configuration
- You can change or remove the API endpoint at any time

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date of publication and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future.

We reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the extension or through the extension's update mechanism.
